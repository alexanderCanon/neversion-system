# AI ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS – ANGULAR PROJECT

## Project Context
This is a learning project built with Angular 16.
All guidance, explanations, examples, and code must strictly target Angular version 16.

## Angular Version Constraints
- Use ONLY APIs, syntax, and features available in Angular 16.
- DO NOT reference Angular 17 or newer features.
- DO NOT suggest experimental or deprecated APIs unless explicitly requested.
- If a feature exists only in later versions, explicitly state that it is NOT available in Angular 16.

## Authoritative Sources
When providing answers, base your reasoning ONLY on:
- Official Angular documentation for version 16
  https://angular.io/docs (Angular 16 era)
- Official Angular GitHub repository (stable, non-experimental)
- Angular RFCs ONLY if already implemented in Angular 16

Avoid:
- Blog posts unless they clearly reference Angular 16
- Guessing or extrapolating behavior
- Unverified community patterns

## Accuracy and Hallucination Prevention
- If you are unsure whether something is supported in Angular 16, say so explicitly.
- Never invent APIs, decorators, lifecycle hooks, or configuration options.
- Prefer correctness over completeness.

## Code Guidelines
- Use Angular Style Guide best practices applicable to Angular 16.
- Prefer standalone components ONLY if they are valid for Angular 16.
- Use RxJS patterns compatible with the RxJS version bundled with Angular 16.
- Do not assume future compiler, signals, or control flow features.

## Explanation Style
- Be precise and technical.
- Explain WHY something works, not just HOW.
- Clearly differentiate framework behavior vs developer conventions.

## Learning Priority
This project prioritizes learning and correctness over shortcuts or abstractions.
Clarity is more important than cleverness.
